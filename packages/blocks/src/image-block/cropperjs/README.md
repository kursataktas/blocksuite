# Cropperjs for BlockSuite

This package is ported from [Cropperjs v2](https://github.com/fengyuanchen/cropperjs).

However, because the original Cropperjs uses an axis system that is not aligned with the BlockSuite's custom axis system, we have to make some changes to the original Cropperjs code.

It means that this package should be used only for the BlockSuite.
